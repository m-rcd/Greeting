# Greeting exercise from Makers Academy Mastery curriculum
I hate my mate Steve: so much so that my hatred spills over to anyone with a first name beginning with 'S'.
I want a program that, when anyone types their name in, shouts at them if their name begins with an 'S'. 
Anyone else should just get a friendly greeting.
